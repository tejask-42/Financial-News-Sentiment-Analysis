# **Welcome to Week 0 of Financial News Sentiment Analysis**

In this week we will cover the basics of python and a few libraries namely NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn that are required to learn core concepts in ML.

This week's assignments are divided into 3 parts

To get started, you can work with .ipynb files on Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks.
Make sure to create a GitHub repository documenting your work week wise.
