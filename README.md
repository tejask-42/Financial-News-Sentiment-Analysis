# Financial News Sentiment Analysis with NLP and Quantitative Trading

## Project Overview

This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with quantitative trading to explore how unstructured textual data (news headlines, financial reports) can be converted into tradable signals. You will learn to build sentiment analysis models, leverage pre-trained language models, and develop trading strategies based on sentiment insights.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Preprocess and clean financial text data using various NLP techniques
- Build and train machine learning models for sentiment classification
- Apply transfer learning using pre-trained models like FinBERT
- Aggregate sentiment signals from multiple sources
- Develop and backtest trading strategies based on sentiment indicators
- Evaluate model performance and understand the limitations of sentiment-driven trading

## Project Structure

The project is organized into weekly modules, each building upon the previous one:

### Week 0: Foundations
Introduction to Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn. Essential libraries and concepts needed for the core project weeks.
- [Week 0 Instructions](./Week%200/README.md)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Git for version control

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejask-42/Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies (as you progress through weeks):
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk transformers torch
```

### How to Use This Repository

1. Start with **Week 0** to ensure you have a solid foundation in Python and essential libraries. Follow the instructions in [Week 0 README](./Week%200/README.md).

2. For each subsequent week:
   - Navigate to the respective week folder
   - Read the week-specific README.md for learning objectives and requirements
   - Complete the assignments and exercises provided
   - Document your work in a personal GitHub repository

3. Work with .ipynb files using either:
   - Google Colab (no local setup required)
   - Jupyter Notebook (run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal)
